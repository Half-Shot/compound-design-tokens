The tokens are defined under the `tokens/` folder and follow the [tokens.studio specification](https://docs.tokens.studio/tokens/json-schema).
They are then transformed to the supported platforms using [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/).

All consumable tokens are generated under `assets/`. Generate them by running

```
yarn build
```
